Thanks for clarifying! Here's an updated plan incorporating **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** for the chatbot:  

---

### **Plan Overview**

**Goal:** Develop a chatbot using LangChain and a pre-trained LLM to implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for querying and responding to a subset of the reference data (~1GB chunk) stored in an SQL database.  

**Key Features:**
- Use RAG to augment LLM responses with accurate database information.
- Focus on quick development using LangChain and existing LLMs.
- Deploy as a stand-alone Azure-hosted application.

---

### **Step-by-Step Plan**

#### **Day 1: Define Scope and Prepare Data**
- **Data Selection:**
  - Extract ~1GB of diverse data from the SQL database.
  - Focus on data that showcases RAG's benefits: textual descriptions, numerical values, and time-series data.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Normalize text fields (e.g., remove unnecessary punctuation, unify formats).
  - Index key fields (e.g., stock symbols, dates) for efficient retrieval.

---

#### **Day 2-3: Environment Setup**
- **Azure Infrastructure:**
  - Provision Azure SQL for hosting the data.
  - Set up Azure Cognitive Search or Elasticsearch to create an index for the reference data to enhance RAG.
  - Deploy Azure App Service for the chatbot backend.
- **Development Environment:**
  - Install key libraries: LangChain, SQLAlchemy, Azure SDKs, OpenAI/Hugging Face SDKs.
  - Set up version control in Azure Repos.

---

#### **Day 4-6: Build Backend Logic**
- **Retrieval Pipeline:**
  - Use **Azure Cognitive Search** (or equivalent) to index and retrieve documents or records relevant to user queries.
  - Design retrieval logic for:
    - Filtering results based on query metadata (e.g., time range, stock symbol).
    - Ranking and returning top-k results.
- **Database API:**
  - Develop APIs to fetch specific records or metadata directly from the SQL database when needed.
- **RAG Integration:**
  - Implement RAG in LangChain:
    - First, use retrieval results as input context for the LLM.
    - Augment LLM responses with retrieved factual data.

---

#### **Day 7-9: Implement Chatbot Logic**
- **LLM Selection and Integration:**
  - Use LangChain's **RetrievalQA Chain** or **ConversationalRetrievalChain**:
    - Connect the retriever (Azure Cognitive Search) to the LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3.5/4 or Hugging Face models like LLaMA-2).
    - Configure prompts to incorporate retrieved context effectively.
  - Fine-tune (optional, for Hugging Face models) on a small set of domain-specific data for improved query understanding.
- **Context Handling:**
  - Implement LangChain memory for multi-turn conversations.
  - Ensure retrieved documents provide enough context to generate accurate and concise answers.

---

#### **Day 10-11: Frontend Development**
- **Interface Design:**
  - Create a simple UI using Streamlit for quick deployment or React for scalability.
  - Features:
    - Input box for natural language queries.
    - Display of chatbot responses with referenced retrievals (highlighted for transparency).
- **User Interaction:**
  - Enable users to review the retrieved context alongside LLM-generated responses.

---

#### **Day 12-13: Azure Deployment**
- **Backend Deployment:**
  - Deploy the RAG pipeline and chatbot logic on Azure App Service.
- **Frontend Deployment:**
  - Host the interface on Azure Static Web Apps or integrate with the backend.
- **Security and Configuration:**
  - Set up environment variables for API keys and database credentials.
  - Ensure RAG retriever and LLM latency are within acceptable limits for a 60-second response time.

---

#### **Day 14: Testing and Validation**
- **Testing Scenarios:**
  - Ensure accuracy of retrieved context and LLM responses for sample queries.
  - Test multi-turn conversations and complex queries.
  - Simulate scenarios where retrievals are missing or incomplete to check fallback responses.
- **Performance Testing:**
  - Measure latency from retrieval to response generation.
  - Ensure scalability of retrieval queries under concurrent requests.

---

#### **Day 15: Demo and Handover**
- **Demonstration:**
  - Show the chatbot's ability to:
    - Retrieve accurate and relevant context.
    - Generate natural language responses with supporting references.
  - Highlight RAG's ability to ensure accuracy and reduce hallucinations.
- **Handover:**
  - Provide documentation covering:
    - RAG pipeline architecture.
    - LangChain configuration.
    - Steps for scaling beyond the PoC.

---

### **LLM Selection**
- **Recommended for RAG:**
  - **OpenAI GPT-3.5/4:** Best for quick development; no fine-tuning needed.
  - **Hugging Face LLaMA-2 or GPT-NeoX:** If on-premise hosting is preferred, fine-tune a base model for better performance on your dataset.
