Plan Overview
Goal: Develop a chatbot using LangChain and an existing LLM to query and respond to a subset of the reference data (~1GB chunk) stored in an SQL database, deployed as a stand-alone Azure-hosted application.

Key Components:

Use a pre-trained LLM for natural language understanding (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4 or Hugging Face models like LLaMA-2 or GPT-NeoX).
Leverage LangChain for orchestrating LLM interactions and database querying.
Focus on a simple query-reply structure with RAG (Red-Amber-Green) system logic.
Step-by-Step Plan
Day 1: Define Scope and Prepare Data
Data Selection:
Extract a representative subset (~1GB) of data from the SQL database.
Ensure the chunk includes varied data types (text, numerical, time-series).
Data Preprocessing:
Clean and standardize data.
Define RAG thresholds for demonstration (e.g., numeric ranges or conditions).
Day 2-3: Environment Setup
Set Up Azure Services:
Provision Azure SQL for hosting the chunk of reference data.
Deploy Azure App Service or Azure Functions for hosting the chatbot.
Development Environment:
Install required libraries: LangChain, SQLAlchemy, FastAPI (for API endpoint), OpenAI/Hugging Face SDKs.
Set up version control in Azure Repos with a simple branching strategy (e.g., dev and main branches).
Day 4-6: Build Backend Logic
Database API:
Develop a simple API layer using SQLAlchemy to query the SQL database.
Create basic endpoints for common queries (e.g., get_record, search_records).
LangChain Integration:
Use LangChain to connect the LLM with the database API.
Implement prompt templates for converting user queries into SQL queries.
Handle natural language query refinement through LangChain's conversational memory.
Day 7-9: Implement Chatbot Logic
LLM Integration:
Choose an LLM:
OpenAI GPT-3.5/4: Excellent out-of-the-box performance, minimal setup.
Hugging Face LLaMA-2 or GPT-NeoX: Fine-tunable, great for local hosting.
Fine-tune (optional, if using Hugging Face models) with 50-100 sample queries and responses from your data.
Response Generation:
Implement logic to:
Retrieve relevant records.
Annotate results with RAG status based on predefined rules.
Generate a natural language response.
Testing:
Test chatbot with sample queries to ensure accuracy and coherence.
Day 10-11: Frontend Development
Interface Design:
Develop a simple frontend using Streamlit (quick deployment) or a minimal React/HTML page.
User Interaction:
Allow users to type queries and view responses with highlighted RAG status.
Ensure clarity in responses with tables or text formats.
Day 12-13: Azure Deployment
Backend Deployment:
Deploy the chatbot logic and database API on Azure App Service or Azure Functions.
Frontend Deployment:
Host the chatbot interface on Azure Static Web Apps or integrate with the backend app.
Configuration:
Set up environment variables for API keys and database connections.
Optimize chatbot and API timeouts to ensure responses within 60 seconds.
Day 14: Testing and Feedback
Conduct end-to-end testing for:
Query accuracy.
RAG logic implementation.
Latency and error handling.
Gather feedback from internal stakeholders to refine the chatbot.
Day 15: Presentation and Handover
Prepare a demo showcasing:
Chatbot features (query handling, RAG system).
Technical architecture and deployment details.
Handover documentation covering:
Codebase structure.
Steps to scale beyond PoC.
LLM Selection
Recommended for PoC:
OpenAI GPT-3.5/4 (API-based):
Pros: Best for quick deployment, high-quality results, no need for fine-tuning.
Cons: Cost scales with usage; dependency on OpenAI servers.
Hugging Face LLaMA-2 (local hosting):
Pros: Open-source, can be fine-tuned; reduces dependency on external APIs.
Cons: Requires more setup and infrastructure; might need fine-tuning for domain-specific data.
