    "    Generator(model_name): generates sentences by utilizing MLEs from specified n-gram model.\n",
    "    Probability(sentence,model_name): Compute the probability of a given sentence in log-space.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Implement add-1 smoothing for bigram model and give 2-3 examples where drastic change in the count occurs post-smoothing. Can you explain this drastic change in a sentence?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Do you observe the constant discounting value ‘d’ by implementing Good-turing smoothing technique? If yes, what is the value of ‘d’? \n",
    "    Hint: You can check for n-grams having original counts between 1-10. \n",
